# Fine-Tuning-LLM-using-LORA
In this project, I fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), optimizing it for minimal resource usage. The model was tailored for educational purposes, focusing on enhancing learning experiences. Additionally, I built a chat interface that allows users to interact with the model for educational tasks efficiently.
